#NACA-4 Digit Design   
This should hopefully be a good guid to 4 Digit NACA designs. 
The NACA series was a system created by NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) to classify foils by a set of numbers.
Classifying them is nice because you can standerdize foil shapes. NACA created a bunch of different foil Series:
the 4 series, the 5 series, ... , all the way up to the 8 series. We are starting out with the 4 series because they are the simplest, 
have only a few constants to evolve, and are easiest to test. 
## Resources 
* [NACA airfoil wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil)There's no better place to start than wikipedia
* [NACA airfoil series pdf](http://people.clarkson.edu/~pmarzocc/AE429/The%20NACA%20airfoil%20series.pdf) A more formal description of the NACA foil series, also describes a bit more of the terminoligy around what a foil is.
* [NACA 4 digit airfoil generator] (http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit) My go to reference. It allows you to play with the Camber, Camber Position, and thickness to see how they effect the foil shape. It also shows the math of how you turn the digits into a foil cross-section, but lacks a bit on some of the context around that math. 

## Backgound 
A foil has a set of terminology that is used to describe its shape. 


A NACA 4 Digit foil, is called a NACA 4 Digit foil, the shape of the foil can be generated from 4 digits. A NACA 4 Digit foil is recognisable by the word **NACA** and the four digits that follow.  
# **NACA MPXX**   
* M is the maximum camber
* P is the position of the maximum camber
* XX is the thickness of the foil
