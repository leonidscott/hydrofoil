#NACA-4 Digit Design   
This should hopefully be a good guid to 4 Digit NACA designs. 
The NACA series was a system created by NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) to classify foils by a set of numbers.
Classifying them is nice because you can standerdize foil shapes. NACA created a bunch of different foil Series:
the 4 series, the 5 series, ... , all the way up to the 8 series. We are starting out with the 4 series because they are the simplest, 
have only a few constants to evolve, and are easiest to test.
